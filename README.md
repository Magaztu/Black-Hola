# Black-Hola
Black-hold simulation with TypeScript.
Yes, the titleâ€™s typo is intentional!

## What's this?
Welp, I got inspired and will try to simulate a blackhole within js/ts.
Maybe it won't be the most efficient sim, but I'll try my best!!

### What's included?
Features like:
 - Currently idk lol, will update l8r

Dependencies:
- Zero

#### What did I learn with this?
Nothing currently, but something substantial hopefully
